# Venture 
Build your Own Choose Your Own Adventure Game (BYOCYOAG) 

Greetings, you browser of GitHub, you. This is the source code for a project called the Venture. Venture is a framework for allowing you to quickly and easily build a choose-your-own-adventure game, or game world. The project is meant to facilitate all of the fun stuff I personally like to do in my free time, including: 

1. Fiction Writing and Consistency Management
2. DND Campaign Management
3. CYOA Games 
4. Interactive Fiction 

How does Venture facilitate such things? Well, I shall tell you. Shortly.
